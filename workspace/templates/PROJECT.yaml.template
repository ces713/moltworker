# =============================================================================
# WHAT GETS GENERATED
# =============================================================================
# When you initialize a project with this config, Mission Control generates:
#
# 1. Database record in `projects` table
# 2. R2 files:
#    - projects/{id}/PROJECT.yaml  - This config file
#    - projects/{id}/CONTEXT.md    - Working context for agents
#    - projects/{id}/ACCESS.md     - Agent access rules
#
# Agents read CONTEXT.md to understand:
# - What they're building (mission, objectives)
# - Quality expectations (scope type)
# - Current phase and recent decisions
#
# =============================================================================
# API ENDPOINTS
# =============================================================================
