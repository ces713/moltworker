description: Sequential phases with gates - requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment
problem_types:
  - software-development
  - enterprise
  - compliance-required

phases:
  - id: requirements
    name: Requirements
    order: 1
    agents: [jarvis]
    deliverables:
      - Complete requirements document
      - User stories with acceptance criteria
      - Scope definition
    gate:
      approver: jarvis
      criteria: All requirements documented and stakeholder-approved

  - id: design
    name: System Design
    order: 2
    agents: [architect]
    depends_on: [requirements]
    deliverables:
      - Architecture document
      - API specifications
      - Database schema
      - Component diagrams
    gate:
      approver: jarvis
      criteria: Design covers all requirements, no ambiguities

  - id: implementation
    name: Implementation
    order: 3
    agents: [backend, frontend]
    depends_on: [design]
    parallel: true
    deliverables:
      - Complete codebase
      - Unit tests
      - Integration points
    gate:
      approver: reviewer
      criteria: All code complete, unit tests passing

  - id: testing
    name: Testing
    order: 4
    agents: [reviewer, hawk]
    depends_on: [implementation]
    deliverables:
      - Test results
      - Security audit report
      - Bug list (if any)
    gate:
      approver: jarvis
      criteria: All critical/high bugs resolved, security approved

  - id: deployment
    name: Deployment
    order: 5
    agents: [jarvis]
    depends_on: [testing]
    deliverables:
      - Production deployment
      - Release documentation
      - Runbook

task_templates:
  - phase: requirements
    subject: "[REQ] Document requirements for {feature}"
    priority: 9

  - phase: design
    subject: "[DESIGN] System design for {feature}"
    priority: 8

  - phase: implementation
    subject: "[IMPL] Implement {component} for {feature}"
    priority: 7

  - phase: testing
    subject: "[TEST] Test {feature}"
    priority: 7

  - phase: deployment
    subject: "[DEPLOY] Deploy {feature} to {environment}"
    priority: 8

strict_rules:
  - No phase can start until previous phase gate is passed
  - Changes to requirements require re-approval
  - Design changes during implementation require architecture review
